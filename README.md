# Forest Cover Type Classification

This project is the final portfolio project provided by Codecademy's Deep Learning with TensorFlow skill path. It aims to analyze cartographic features to classify the most common forest cover type.

## Dataset Overview

The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. The cover types are as follows:

1. **Spruce/Fir**  
2. **Lodgepole Pine**  
3. **Ponderosa Pine**  
4. **Cottonwood/Willow**  
5. **Aspen**  
6. **Douglas-fir**  
7. **Krummholz**

Independent variables were derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data also contains binary columns for qualitative independent variables like wilderness areas and soil type.

### Study Area

The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These forests represent ecosystems with minimal human disturbances, where existing forest cover types result primarily from ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

## Project Features

- Utilized **Callbacks** to enhance model performance.  
- Incorporated **TensorBoard** for monitoring training progress and visualizations.  
- Performed **Hyperparameter Tuning** to optimize the model for better classification accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- TensorBoard  
- Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  

## Objective

To build a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying forest cover types based on cartographic features.
